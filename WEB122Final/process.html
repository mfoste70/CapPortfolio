      <h3>Preface</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the multitude of rubrics provided in the assignment, I believe
        we are to make a presentation/resource-hub website organizing all of our
        design and development materials. The structure of this research base
        will roughly follow the third rubric provided. All images will be
        openable with click while large text pieces will link to where they can
        be read. (i.e., If it was written on a Google Doc, I will provide a link
        to the doc)
      </p>

      <h3>Audit Materials</h3>
      <p>
        The non-profit I chose for this assignment is "reStart", a local
        organization and charity that works in the Kansas City area. It
        specializes in assisting those suffering from homelessness and/or a lack
        of support. I personally have not pursued aid from this charity, but I
        do have experience with charities and organizations like it.

        Some elements were not used in the current state of the final product,
        but I'd rather have them and not need them than need them and not have
        them.

      <h3>Design Brief</h3>
      <p>
        While the previous site fell flat mostly in terms of responsiveness,
        there are still quite a few departments in which it can be
        built/immproved upon.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The primary goal is establishing actual responsive behavior within the
          site's well-constructed presentation
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Condensed/truncated Navigation elements for mobile use</li>
          <li>Varied levels of scaling, especially for mobile devices</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          There should be a major emphasis on color to both influence the
          end-user's emotions and guide them to any resources/services
          applicable to them.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Blue to guide families due to its calming effects.</li>
          <li>
            Green to guide youths and provide them with a sense of "going in the
            right direction"
          </li>
          <li>
            Purple for individuals so as to influence them into feeling a bit
            more confident.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Interactables and Images should be large enough for vision-impaired
          and technology-inexperienced users to understand. and easily access
        </li>
        <li>
          Sloped corners and dulled edges should be applied to as to contribute
          to a more clean and comforting user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
