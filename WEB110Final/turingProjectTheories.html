        <h2>The Turing Test</h2>
        <p>One of the most famous theories developed by Turing was that of the Turing Test (sometimes also called the Imitation Game). Popular in Sci-fi narratives and modern A.I. development alike, the Turing Test helps draw a line between computers that can truly "think" or not by pitting it in a questionaire  against a real flesh-and-blood human. An observer would provide questions, and both participants would attempt to answer them as best they could.</p>
        <p>There have been many interpretations and variants to Turing's famous test, but none can deny the sheer number of accurate predictions it has in relation to the modern technological world.</p>

        <h2>Spinoff: The Chinese Room</h2>
        <p>Getting into the territory of "Turing didn't do it, but he inspired some other guy to do it", is the relatively unknown Chinese Room hypothetical. This scenario depicts a woman -lets just say her name is Luna, for ease of reading- alone in a room with a pen, sone paper, a series of bookshelves, and an ominous door which has a small slot (similar to that of a solid prision door). Letters would come in -written purely in Chinese- but Luna doesn't understand a single word of any language aside from English. But the books that line her room are filled to the brim with college textbooks and translation guides between English and Chinese. Luna gets to work, slowly piecing together as much about the Chinese language as she can and responding to the letters; The subject of which varies from facts about her life to her current feelings and thoughts.</p>
        <p>This example humanizes the process of machine learning while having some odd etichal questions and kidnapping implications. Despite that however, this is a facinating hypothetical that is still widely thought upon today with the new levels of A.I. development.</p>

        <h3>Secret Treasure</h3>
        <p>Due to the instability of WWII, it is said that Turing invested a majority of his savings into two silver bars (adj. $9,800) and buried them in a forest, with only a complex code as a guide. He, however, could not crack his own code, and the bars are said to still be located in Bletchley Park</p>
