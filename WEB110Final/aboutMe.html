        <a href="media/face2.jpg"><img src="media/face2.jpg" alt="Picture of my face, not much else."></a>
        <p>I'm a tech-enthusiast and aspiring web-developer looking to improve and potentially showcase my skills. Having just started taming the beast that is Higher Education, I don't have much professional-quality experience under my belt. But I <em>have</em> spent a majority of my personal life toying and tinkering with most things computer-based; Primarily  on the software side, but I've dabbled in parts/assembly behind computers before. This has also led me to have a -self-proclaimed- affinity for the dreaded art of... Tech Support across all major Operating Systems.<br><br>
        Also, due to an unfortunate genetic lottery my hair is just kinda like that. Mind of its own.</p>

        <h2>...as a Creator</h2>
        <p>While I don't have much time nowadays to create like I did before, every once in a while I get the chance to let that internal spirit free. Either through composing music or meeting weekly with some friends to play Tabletop RPGs, I try to provide some enrichment to the mopey zoo lion that is my brain.</p>
        <p>(see my <a href="Interests.html">Interests</a> for a more detailed look at what I've made in the past and what I'm doing in the future)</p>
