        <h2>The Man Himself</h2>
        <p>Born in London to a well-off religous family, Alan Turing showed many signs of genius from an early age; Bypassing most of his peers in the study of Science and Mathematics while just <em>casually</em> decifering the thought process behind Einstein's analysis of Newton's fundamental laws of motion. At 16.</p>
        <p>After countless awards, contributions, and published papers, Turing went on to perform such feats as: 
        </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Developing the Bomba and Bombe, two versions of a cipher for the radio messages sent during WWII</li>
        <li>Redefining what human brains were in the context of computing</li>
        <li>Developing more efficient forms of comptuers and computing processes; Both large and small scale</li>
        <li>Establishing the Turing Test and the foundations of A.I. development (Read more about that <a href="turingProjectTheories.html">Here</a>)</li>
        <li>Accidentally becoming a figurehead for the modern day social justice movement by being charged with “gross indecency” (being gay), and subequently having a majority of his work and progress invalidated. This was recently recognised as a "bad move" by the British Government, as the late Queen Elizabeth II would grant him a long-overdue public apology and Royal Pardon in 2009</li>
      </ol>

        <h2>The Little Things</h2>
        <p>Turing was ofted described by his colleagues as "eccentric" due to his odd and lackadaisical behavior. Despite this however, he was widely regarded as a genius among geniuses by his colleages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>He chained coffee cups to his desk in order to prevent stealing.</li>
          <li>He accidentally became a near-olympic-class runner from his long commutes, and to "escape the intense stress" that came with his work.</li>
          <li>When he <em>did</em> ride a bike, it was said that the chain on it was broken in a specific spot that routinely caused it to malfuntion. Instead of fixing it however, Turing would count the exact degree of pedal rotation needed to trigger the effect, hop off, readjust the chain, and go on with his day, just to do the same thing a couple moments later.</li>
          <li>Just to reiterate/emphasize; <em>He kept up with Einstein's discussions over Newton's Laws of Physics</em>. At 16. Without any knoledge of Calculus. Wild.</li>
