        <h2>Music Composition</h2>
        <p>While I don't typically publish what I make, I've always wanted to get some of my musical pieces out there on the Internet. That combined with some recent events has led me to start actually sharing my little hobby of composition with the world; Even if it means just learning how to attach .mp3 files in HTML.
        <br> 
        Kindly don't use these snippets for anything, as they belong to me and that would make me feel mildly displeased/sad. You have been warned of my potentially mild dissapointment.</p>

        <div class="musicWrapper">
          <p><strong>Placeholder 1:</strong> First is a piece I made just after my High School Musical Composition course ended. I was still riding off of that creative flow, hence the vague pretentiousness.</p>

          <p><strong>Gone:</strong> This piece, while being my most recent one to enter the late stage of -good enough- is also my most emotionally charged. I don't want to get too personal cuz that would get really sad really quickly, but I hope that I've reflected that feeling of loss and progress.</p>

          <p><strong>Six-Eight:</strong> This piece was the result of me trying to get out of my comfort zone of writing in the time signature I was trained in; 3/4. Starting out with Classical writing, I always liked waltzes and concertos and based my pieces after them. But this time around, I decided to change it up, hence the name. </p>

        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>Though I get very little time to partake, I've had a long and -mostly- pleasant time playing video games. They're actually what inspired me to start playing/writing music. Unrelated, but thank god for mobile games though, long commutes are so much easier with a quick game of solitaire. Pardon the rambling.</p>

            <td>Though I haven't played much after completing the main story, Pyre is one of those games that completely rewrites everything you learned along the way. Wonderful characters, engaging story, beautiful soundtrack, and an ending personalized to your decisions. Also, this was the predecessor to GOTY "Hades", so theres that.</td>

            <td>Though there are many memes across the Internet proclaiming its "critically acclaimed"  and "award-winning" status, I can proudly say that those labels aren't just for show. While theres many issues with AAA titles (especially in recent years), the XIV dev-team still maintains a complex narative since all the way back in 2013 with no signs of stopping. (And its got an unlimited free trial, too)</td>

            <td>An oldie but a goodie nontheless, Bravely Default released on the 3DS back in 2012 to a small but devoted cult following. As a spinoff of the Final Fantasy series, it borrows from the class systems of III, XIII, and Tactics, while adding a brand new spin to the Turn-Based structures of old. I don't want to say too much for spoiler purposes, but I can say that it really is worth the time and effort.</td>
